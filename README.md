#### Video Demo:

#### Description:
A simple flashcard web application built on Flask using Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
User can also automatically generate e-flashcards from dictionary lookups (currently supporting only English-English flahscards).

#### Features:
- Add, remove, or edit a flashcard set
- Create a flashcard manually or automatically from dictionary lookup (English words and phrases only)
- Review a set with the option to randomize the cards.

#### What's Included in the Directory:
The directory includes two folders and three files.
The two folders, named `static` and `templates`, contain the CSS stylesheet and the HTML templates used for this project, respectively.
The first file `application.py` stores the main function of this application. The second file `helpers.py` contains the helpers functions to be used for validating user's lookup request, prompting user to log into the application, and rendering error messages. The last file `vocab.db` is a SQLite database used for storing user's data.

#### Usage:
Here is an overview of how the application works:
1. User will be prompted to sign into their account before they have access to the rest of the application. They must create an account if they do not have one.
2. Onced logged in, user will be redirected to the main page which displays all of their flashcard sets (if any). User can choose to review, edit, or remove any existing sets. The navigation bar now displays four options, `New Set` and `New Flashcard` on the left side, and `Change Password` and `Log Out` on the right side.
3. User must have at least one flashcard set before they can create a flashcard with `New Flashcard`.
4. User can create their flashcards in two ways. They can either manually enter the definition(s) or have the application copy-paste the definition(s) from Wiktionary (the term must be English).
5. If the user's input is invalid, the application will render an error message explaining why the input was rejected.

#### What's Stored in the SQL Database:
The `vocab.db` database consists of four tables for storing users, their flashcard sets and the content of each set. Each entry of each table is assigned a unique index (ID), which gives the application the ability to access any flashcard set and flashcard upon user's request.
1. The `users` table stores the registered users of the application. Each entry includes the user's display name, username, password hash, and ID.
2. The `folders` table stores the flashcard sets owned by each user. Each entry includes the owner's ID, the ID and title of the set, and the number of flashcards inside the set (the default value is 0).
3. The `words` table stores the front side of a flashcard i.e the term. Each entry includes the owner's ID, the ID of the set containing the card, and the front side of the card.
4. The `definitions` table stores the back side of a flashcard i.e the definition(s) of the term. Each entry includes the owner's ID, the ID of the set containing the card, the ID of the card, and the back of the card. If there are more than one definition, then each definition will be assigned a unique index.

The structure of this database allows a user to own multiple sets, each of which can contain multiple flashcards, and to include as many definitions in a flashcard as they want.

#### How This Application Uses BeautifulSoup4 to Generate Flashcards Automatically:
BeautifulSoup4 (BS4) is a Python library for scraping data from a HTML or XML file. The application can utilize this libary to look up any English term on Wiktionary and extract from the page a list of definitions that can be added to the flashcard. I chose Wiktionary as the online dictionary source for my application due to its relatively simple HTML tree structure, allowing the application to search and retrieve the definitions with ease.
The application will send a GET request to Wiktionary with `requests.get(url)`, where url is the link to the Wiktionary page corresponding to the English term of interest. Any whitespaces and punctuations in the term will be converted into appropriate characters to ensure the requested url is in the correct format.
HTML elements containing the English definitions of the term will be obtained with `find_all` with the class and tag names of the parent elements being specified. The text of the elements will be extracted, reformatted, and appended to an array to be returned to the user.
